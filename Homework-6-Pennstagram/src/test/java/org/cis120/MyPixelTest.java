     * Remember, UNIT tests should ideally have one point of failure. Below we
     * give you two examples of unit tests for the Pixel constructor, one that
     * takes in three ints as arguments and one that takes in an array. We use
     * the getRed(), getGreen(), and getBlue() methods to check that the values
     * were set correctly. These two tests do not comprehensively test all of
     * Pixel so you must add your own.
     * 
     * You might want to look into assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, and
     * assertArrayEquals at the following:
     * http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Assert.html
     *
     * Note, if you want to add global variables so that you can reuse Pixels
     * in multiple tests, feel free to do so.
